## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 English, Not Legalese

Data privacy is important, and we want you to understand the issues involved. We have decided to use plain English as much as possible, to make our terms as clear as possible.

Where you read *The Matrix.org Foundation C.I.C.*, *The Matrix.org Foundation*, or *The Foundation*, it refers to the Community Interest Company incorporated on 29 October 2018 to be the neutral custodian of the Matrix protocol: The Matrix Foundation C.I.C., and their agents.

Where you read *New Vector*, *New Vector Ltd.*, *we* or *us* below, it refers to the company created in July 2017 to hire the Matrix core team and support Matrix's development: New Vector Ltd., its French subsidiary: New Vector SARL, and their agents.

**A note to other startups:** this document was heavily inspired by [Balsamiq's plain English ToS document](https://docs.balsamiq.com/mybalsamiq/tos/). We were impressed by their championing of plain English, and wanted to reproduce that as much as possible in our own legal documentation. Feel free to draw similar inspiration from this document, though be sure to get any documents you produce checked over by a lawyer. Good luck!
